Does the second sentence mean that \emph{all} old TV shows are in black and white; or that most of them are; or that most of the things which are in black and white are old TV shows? I have gone with the former, but it is not clear that FOL deals with these well.}

\problempart Consider the sentence,
\begin{compactlist}[start=19,ref=\arabic*]
	\item\label{except2} Every officer except Pavel owes money to Hikaru.
\end{compactlist}
Symbolize this sentence, using `$\atom{F}{x}$' for `\gap{x} is an officer'.  Are you confident that your symbolization is true if, and only if, sentence~\ref{except2} is true?  What happens if every officer owes money to Hikaru, Pavel does not, but Pavel isn't an officer? \myanswer{Most people, including most linguists thinking about `except', read sentence~\ref{except2} as entailing all three of the following:
\begin{compactlist}
	\item Every officer who is not Pavel owes money to Hikaru
	\item Pavel does not owe money to Hikaru
	\item Pavel is an officer
\end{compactlist}
So it can be symbolized as `$\forall x((\atom{F}{x} \eand \enot x = p) \eif \atom{O}{x,h}) \eand \enot \atom{O}{p,h} \eand \atom{F}{p}$'.}

\problempart Explain why:
	\begin{ebullet}
		\item   `$\exists x \forall y(\atom{A}{y} \eiff x= y)$' is a good symbolization of `there is exactly one apple'.
		\item[] \myanswer{We might naturally read this in English thus: 
		\begin{ebullet}
			\item There is something, $x$, such that, if you choose any object at all, if you chose an apple then you chose $x$ itself, and if you chose $x$ itself then you chose an apple.
		\end{ebullet}
		The $x$ in question must therefore be the one and only thing which is an apple.}
		\item `$\exists x \exists y \bigl[\enot x = y \eand \forall z(\atom{A}{z} \eiff (x= z \eor y = z)\bigr]$' is a good symbolization of `there are exactly two apples'.
		\item[] \myanswer{Similarly to the above, we might naturally read this in English thus: 
		\begin{ebullet}
			\item There are two distinct things, $x$ and $y$, such that if you choose any object at all, if you chose an apple then you either chose $x$ or $y$, and if you chose either $x$ or $y$ then you chose an apple.
		\end{ebullet}
		The $x$ and $y$ in question must therefore be the only things which are apples, and since they are distinct, there are two of them.}

Comment: I am reading this as `there are \emph{at least} two\ldots'. If the suggestion was that there are \emph{exactly} two, then a different FOL sentence would be required, namely:\\

Comment: if there is not exactly one deuce of clubs, then the above sentence is true. Maybe that's the wrong verdict. Perhaps the sentence should definitely be taken to imply that there is one and only one deuce of clubs, and then express a conditional about wildness. If so, then we might symbolize it thus:
