# forall x: Calgary

[![Book Cover](https://forallx.openlogicproject.org/forallxyyc.png)](https://forallx.openlogicproject.org/forallxyyc.pdf)

## Description

_forall x: Calgary_ is a full-featured textbook on formal logic. It
covers key notions of logic such as consequence and validity of
arguments, the syntax of truth-functional propositional logic TFL and
truth-table semantics, the syntax of first-order (predicate) logic FOL
with identity (first-order interpretations), symbolizing English in
TFL and FOL, and Fitch-style natural deduction proof systems for both
TFL and FOL. It also deals with some advanced topics such as modal
logic, soundness, and functional completeness. Exercises with
solutions are available. It is provided in PDF (for screen reading,
printing, and a special version for dyslexics), HTML (with additional
[accessibility
features](https://forallx.openlogicproject.org/html/A4.html)), and in
LaTeX source code.

Instructors wishing to adopt it should consider the open-source
[Carnap](https://carnap.io/) system, which supports the notation and
proof systems of _forall x: Calgary_. Check out the [sample
exercises](https://carnap.io/shared/rzach@ucalgary.ca/forall%20x:%20Calgary.md)
for the book on carnap.io. (There is also an outdated and unsupported
proof editor/checker for the proof system used available at
[proofs.openlogicproject.org](https://proofs.openlogicproject.org/).)

The book has been translated into German ([forall _x_:
Dortmund](https://github.com/sbwimmer/forallx-do)) and Portuguese
([Para Tod*x*s:
Natal](https://github.com/Grupo-de-Estudos-em-Logica-da-UFRN/Para-Todxs-Natal)).

## Read online

The book is available in HTML [to read
online](https://forallx.openlogicproject.org/html/).

The HTML conversion is experimental. If you find issues in it,
especially issues that affect screen readers, please report it by
[filing an issue](https://github.com/rzach/forallx-yyc/issues) or send
an email to [Richard Zach](mailto:rzach@ucalgary.ca). Note that
solutions are not yet included in the HTML version.

The a [SCORM](https://adlnet.gov/past-projects/scorm/) ZIP package of
HTML bundled with plain and accessible versions of the PDF is
available here:

  - [SCORM.forallxyyc.zip](https://forallx.openlogicproject.org/SCORM.forallxyyc.zip)

You can use this file to easily provide the entire text inside your
LMS (Canvas, Moodle, D2L/Brightspace).

**Note that these files change whenever the source files change.** So
if you use the text in a course, it is best to download the PDFs or
the SCORM package and make them available to students directly rather
than to link here, to avoid mismatches between versions.

Major changes between editions are listed in the [changelog](https://github.com/rzach/forallx-yyc/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Buy a Printed Copy

If you'd like to purchase a nice paperback copy of the Fall 2023
edition, you can do so on Amazon
([US](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CH2B1ZFG) |
[CA](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0CH2B1ZFG) |
[UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CH2B1ZFG) |
[DE](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0CH2B1ZFG) |
[AU](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B0CH2B1ZFG)), or use search in your
local Amazon store. Be sure to get the latest version that's available
in print (Fall 2023). The version on Amazon usually is not as current
as the PDF. Changes are recorded in the
[Changelog](https://github.com/rzach/forallx-yyc/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

(The process for getting the book printed is described
[here](https://openlogicproject.org/2015/11/22/getting-your-book-to-print/)
and
[here](https://openlogicproject.org/2017/05/19/forall-x-yyc-is-now-on-amazon-and-how-it-got-there/).)

## Make PDFs Yourself

Clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rzach/forallx-yyc) locally or download the ZIP file and run [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) on one of

  - `forallxyyc.tex` (in color, for screen reading)
  - `forallxyyc-accessible.tex` (accessible version)
  - `forallxyyc-print.tex` (b/w, for printing on Quarto stock)
  - `forallxyyc-letter.tex` (b/w, for printing on regular letter-size paper)

You'll have to run `makeglossaries` to produce the glossary as well,
or use `latexmk`.

To make changes to the definitions in the preamble and `forallyyc.sty`
file, put them in a file named `forallxyyc-local.sty`. For instance,
to get the connectives to be ∼, &, ⊃, ≡ instead of ¬, ∧, →, ↔, and
atomic formulas _Lab_ instead of _L(a,b)_, copy
`forallxyyc-local-sample.sty` to that file.

## Convert to HTML

To convert the book to HTML:

- Install [LaTeXML](https://math.nist.gov/~BMiller/LaTeXML/).
- Install [BookML](https://vlmantova.github.io/bookml/) and its
  dependencies. If your source files live in, say, `~/forallx-yyc` you
  should have a subdirectory `~/forallx-yyc/bookml`.
- run `make -f Bookml.mk` from inside `~/forallx-yyc`.

If this works, your HTML files can be found in
`~/forallx-yyc/auxdir/html/forallxyyc-html/` and the SCORM package in
`~/forallx-yyc/SCORM.forallxyyc-html.zip`.
